= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

.CURL
include::{snippets}/home/curl-request.adoc[]

.HTTPie
include::{snippets}/home/httpie-request.adoc[]

.Request
include::{snippets}/home/http-request.adoc[]

.Request Body
include::{snippets}/home/request-body.adoc[]

.Response
include::{snippets}/home/http-response.adoc[]

.Response Body
include::{snippets}/home/response-body.adoc[]

.Response Fields
include::{snippets}/home/response-fields.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
